    "about":"This project was created for my graded unit in my final year of college for my HND, the project brief was to create a website for a Gym that incorporated accounts, a booking system, account system and an admin panel.\n\nThe project achieved an A for the graded unit, the project taught me a lot about time management and working within the agile development methodology.\n\nMy time at college and projects such as my graded unit provided me with a general idea of what it's like to work within the software development industry and provided me with a good practical knowledge of development."
